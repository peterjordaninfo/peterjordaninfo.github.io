      <description>I’ve been following the trials, tribulations and successes of colleagues in their weeknotes over the last while. So now I’m having a go - to share my working week as Head of Performance and Data Analysis at GDS.
I started writing some notes last week, but before I knew it, it was this week. So here are two weeks worth.
